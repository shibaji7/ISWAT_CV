## Welcome to Coronal Hole Boundary Detection using CHRIPS Algorithm

This project is a part of [COSPAR ISWAT](https://www.iswat-cospar.org/iswat-cospar). The COSPAR ISWAT initiative is a global hub for collaborations addressing challenges across the field of space weather.


### The objectives of this work are following: 
- First, to build a `openCV` and `CNN` based automated coronal hole detection schemes. 
- Second, to develop strategies to quantitatively assess the spatial and temporal uncertainty of coronal hole boundary locations. 
- Third, to use this information to further improve the predictive capabilities of ambient solar wind models.
